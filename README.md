# Glintz Project

We used React to build a simple job profile page for this project. React.js on the front end and Node.js on the back end. SQL has been used to create the database.

## Configure Backend End

1.`npm install`

#### 2.`npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

## Configure Front End

1.`cd client`\
 2.`npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
